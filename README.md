# VIDEO_KYC
Video kyc project to provide a faster KYC option rather than a manual KYC.


For now we are experimenting on document style images in such a way that we can match the images from older documents to the current person. For this to work we are looking for experimenting the indian image dataset. If possibel we will edit images to get a doc style image. For matching the similarity between images we are implementing siamese network which will give embeddings of two faces. 

GAN's also will be useful in order to generate more images of like faces but for GAN's 1st we need data which will be analysed in above step and for that we need to wait till above step to be intermediate stage. 

Further I will update as project goes...
