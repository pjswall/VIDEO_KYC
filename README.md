# VIDEO_KYC
Video kyc project to provide a faster KYC option rather than a manual KYC.


For now we are experimenting on document style images in such a way that we can match the images from older documents to the current person. For this to work we are looking for experimenting the indian image dataset. If possible we will edit images to get a doc style image. For matching the similarity between images we are implementing siamese network which will give embeddings of two faces. 

GAN's also will be useful in order to generate more images of like faces but for GAN's 1st we need data which will be analysed in above step and for that we need to wait till above step to be intermediate stage. 

As data collection part is going on and we have collected images for our work. So, next task is to style the images in order to generate more no. of images for the finetuning. More will be better.

Further update i will add...
